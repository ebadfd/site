## Why Block Recently Registered Domains?

Most phishing campaigns and malware attacks rely on newly registered domains. Attackers purchase fresh domains just days or hours before launching their attacks, 
ensuring they bypass reputation-based blacklists.

- 70%+ of NRDs are classified as malicious or suspicious (Tripwire Research)
- Many exist only for a few days or even hours before disappearing
- NRDs are 10x more likely to be unsafe than trusted domains

Blocking or flagging NRDs provides a critical early warning that significantly reduces your exposure to cyber threats.

## How RRD Protects You

RRD adds a protective layer directly in your browser by checking domain registration dates against your configured threshold (default: 30 days).

- Flag suspicious domains – Get instant alerts when visiting sites registered within the last 30 days.
- Customizable threshold – Adjust the number of days to match your personal risk tolerance.
- Seamless browsing – Browse normally; RRD only warns you when necessary.

Works with encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT) – Even if DNS filters are bypassed, RRD still alerts you.

## Who Is RRD For?

- Individuals – Add enterprise-grade NRD protection without special hardware or DNS services.
- Professionals – Use RRD alongside DNS filtering (like NextDNS) for layered defense.
- Security Researchers – Monitor suspicious domains directly inside your browser.
