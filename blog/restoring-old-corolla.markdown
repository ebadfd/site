** eurobeat intensifies

> This blog documents the joy, frustration, and occasional existential dread of reviving a Toyota Corolla Sprinter Trueno. Expect rust, regrets, 
> and maybe redemption — all in the name of JDM dreams and questionable financial decisions.

So, I recently stumbled into a project I didn’t know I needed.

While casually scrolling through Facebook Marketplace, I saw someone selling a Toyota 3A engine. Out of curiosity, I messaged the guy — just to ask what car it came from.
“A Trueno,” he said. That instantly caught my attention. I pressed a bit further and asked if he was planning to sell the whole car. His response? “Kinda… but come check it out first.”

I did exactly that.

The car turned out to be an old Toyota Corolla Sprinter Trueno — and not just any Trueno. This one was a former hill climb racer, with a bit of local legend attached to it.

It once roared through the hills of Sri Lanka, but when I found it, it was far from glorious — stripped down, tucked away in a garage, and looking heartbreakingly forgotten. 

The previous owner had started a restoration project, but like many ambitious builds, it was left unfinished. For over a year, it had been sitting idle, gathering dust and slowly fading into obscurity.

We had a thorough look around, verified what parts were still there (and what wasn’t), and despite a few missing components, the deal wasn’t bad. So we went for it.

This is what We signed up for — the very first time I saw the car in all its faded glory.

After spending a few days inspecting the shell, sorting through the parts, and digging into the legal side of things, we made our initial payment on 2025-04-10. 
A week later, on 2025-04-17, the deal was done — and the car was officially ours. We moved it to the tinkering spot, where the real journey begins.

Here are some photos from the day we moved the car — along with shots of the parts we collected, sorted, and organized before the big move.

A big shout-out to [**RoadSquad**](https://www.instagram.com/roadsquad.lk) for making the move hassle-free. They handled the tow with total professionalism and care, which made a stressful day feel a lot smoother.

Once all the purchasing and paperwork were wrapped up, we moved the car to the paint shop around 2025-04-18. 
Unfortunately, due to a few delays, we couldn't get started right away and had to wait a few more days before work could begin.

## Before the Strip-Down: A Glimpse Into the Past

You might be wondering what the car looked like before it was stripped to a bare shell. Luckily, after a bit of light OSINT digging,
we managed to find a few photos from the previous owner — showing the car before the restoration journey began.

Turns out, it used to wear a bold shade of purple before any of the paint removal or bodywork started.

Here are some of those early shots:

# So... Where's the Rust?

Haha, like any old car, this one had a few surprises waiting for us. We found several rust spots that needed attention — no shock there. 
Thankfully, since the car was already stripped to a bare shell with the paint removed down to the metal, spotting the problem areas was pretty straightforward. 

Here are the main rust spots we identified.

### Inside the Shell: Surprisingly Solid

Thankfully, the inner shell was in pretty decent shape. Aside from some rust on the firewall, most of it held up remarkably well — even the trunk area was clean, 
with no major corrosion in sight. The firewall rust, while present, wasn’t anything unfixable.

Here’s a quick video showing how it looked.

<video url="https://cdn.ebadfd.tech/ae86-restore/rust/inner-shell.mp4"> </vide>

Unfortunately, the firewall didn’t fare as well — there was noticeable rust damage that will need some serious attention.

### Rocker Panel: A Tough Spot

The rocker panel was in rough shape — mostly rusted through. We decided it was best to completely re-fabricate this part due to the extensive damage.

Here’s how it looked:

<video url="https://cdn.ebadfd.tech/ae86-restore/rust/rocker-panel.mp4"> </vide>


### Floor Boards: Minor Repairs Needed

We found a few small rust spots on the floor boards — around 2-3 cm holes here and there. Thankfully, these are easy fixes and nothing too serious.

Here’s a look at the floor board after the fabrication work so far:

# Other Major Damage

There were a few other areas that needed serious attention — one of the biggest was the door pillar.
Apparently, someone had attempted to repair rust there in the past but stopped halfway, leaving a large cut in the pillar.
We definitely wanted to fix this properly.

Thankfully, we’re able to fabricate a replacement and sort it out, so it’s not too big of a deal in the end.

Here’s how the door pillar looked after the repair:

## The Battle Scar

We also found signs of old accident damage — probably from a drift gone wrong. 
Someone had repaired it in the past, but the job wasn’t exactly top-tier. At first, we considered redoing the fix properly, but after evaluating it closely, 
we decided it wasn’t worth the risk.

Repairing it would have meant a major body cut, something we wanted to avoid to preserve the structural integrity of the car. 
While it won’t be visible after paint and finishing, the mark will always be there.

Maybe we can just call it a battle scar.

After stripping off the black paint, this is how the damage looked.

And here’s how it looked after applying the initial coat of paint on the pillars:

## Inner Door Panel: Chopped and Rebuilt

You might notice that the inner door panel on the right side looks a little unusual — that’s because a section of it had been cut out at some point.
The exact reason isn’t clear. It might’ve been for weight reduction or possibly to make room for a custom setup.

That said, the cut section was actually quite important, as it’s where the door cards attach and where components like the glass locks and window mechanisms are mounted.

The outer door shell was still in good shape, and since AE86 doors are quite pricey, replacing the entire door wasn’t our first option.
Instead, we decided to fabricate the missing section — and we’re happy to say it worked out nicely.

Here’s how the panel looked before the fix:

# Naked Steel: Cleaning Up for the Real Work

Once most of the tinkering was complete, we began prepping the body for paint by stripping it down to bare metal.
This was a necessary step to ensure a clean surface and give the new paint the best possible finish.

While working through the panels, we came across a generous amount of body filler (cataloy) — possibly used during earlier restoration efforts or styling work.
Regardless of the reason, we decided to remove it and bring everything back to metal for a fresh and solid foundation.

With some grinding and patience, we cleaned up the panels and got everything ready for the next phase.

# Starting the Foundation: Primer Application Begins

Started on: 2025-05-22

With the body fully stripped and cleaned down to bare metal, it was time to lay the groundwork — starting with primer.
This stage is essential to protect the metal from rust and prepare the surface for proper panel alignment and future paint.

We're approaching this process step by step, beginning with the right side of the car. The focus here was on the body panels — making sure everything lines up cleanly before moving forward.

Here are a few shots from the initial primer application phase:

# Starting the Foundation: Filler Application and Body Alignment

With the primer applied, we moved on to the next crucial step—applying the filler and aligning the body panels. This phase involved a significant amount of work to get everything properly straightened and adjusted.

Despite the challenges, we made solid progress. The panels were carefully aligned to ensure tight, clean lines across the car, setting the foundation for the AE86’s sharp and refined look.

After completing the full application of primer and necessary bodywork, we moved on to wet sanding the entire shell.
This process involved carefully cutting the surface while continuously adding water—an essential step to ensure all the body lines and contours aligned perfectly.
Though it was a meticulous and time-consuming task, we managed to complete it within a day. This prep work was critical in getting the car ready for the first coat of paint, 
and it made a noticeable difference in how well the body lines popped after sanding.

After completing the wet sanding process, we moved on to applying the primer. For this stage, we chose to use a urethane primer—a high-build, 
durable option that's ideal for surfacing and sealing the body before paint. Urethane primer is particularly effective in filling minor imperfections and providing a smooth, 
even surface, which is crucial after the sanding stage.

Applying the primer after wet sanding ensures that the body is clean, smooth, and ready to accept the primer uniformly. 
This step also helps highlight any final imperfections or inconsistencies in the body lines, which can be addressed before moving on to the base coat. 
Overall, using urethane primer at this point sets a strong foundation for the first layer of paint to bond properly and ensures a high-quality, long-lasting finish.

# Laying Down the Color: First Coat of Paint Applied

Started on: 2025-07-01

After all the prep work—including bodywork, wet sanding, and priming—we moved on to applying the first coat of paint to the exterior of the car. 
It's important to note that this is not the final color—this initial layer is primarily a test coat, used to reveal any imperfections, misalignments, 
or inconsistencies in the bodywork that might have been missed earlier.

At this stage, we focused solely on the outer body, as the interior still requires cleaning and sanding before it can be addressed. 
Even so, seeing the body in a uniform color—even if temporary—was a huge milestone. It gave us a clearer view of the car’s shape and progress, 
and marked the transition from preparation to refinement.
