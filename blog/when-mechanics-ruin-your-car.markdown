Normally, I keep this blog focused on tech, security, programming — and sometimes a bit about car building. But this time, I can’t hold back a rant.

A friend of mine went through one of the worst experiences with a so-called **"performance mechanic."**

He gave his car in for what should've been a straightforward job — **engine rebuild, gearbox inspection, and shock rebuild.**

What he got instead was three months of excuses, a heap of new problems, and a massive bill of **around 7 lakhs** for work that was half-done and badly executed.

Let me break it down.

---

## The Nightmare Breakdown

- **Three months of waiting** — only to get the car back in *worse condition*.  
- **Engine rebuild** — low on power, as if the legendary Toyota 4A-GE had been neutered. It could barely keep up with a kei car. A proper rebuild would have restored its high-rev character and smooth delivery.  
- **Gearbox mount** — loose on arrival. A loose mount can misalign the transmission and create vibrations that damage the gearbox or chassis.  
- **Parts ordered** — wrong ones installed anyway. Some didn’t even fit, yet they were bolted on regardless.  
- **ITBs** — not balanced, making throttle response uneven and the engine run rough.  
- **Engine mounts** — “rebuilt” but later found broken again, leaving the engine insecure.  
- **Oil changes** — the mechanic did two before handing over, because he *flooded the ignition chamber with fuel once*.

\*This is the invoice for just the parts ordered from overseas. Not including the money spent on parts such as spark plugs, workshop charges etc

## The Spark Plug Scam

Brand-new spark plugs were installed, and the performance mechanic assured they were genuine.
The seller later confirmed they were **duplicates**, but my friend was charged full OEM price anyway.  

Even worse, the plugs were **ruined immediately** because the ignition timing was completely wrong. A performance engine needs precise timing — otherwise it loses power, misfires, and can damage the valves.

---

## Starter Motor Mess

Twice, the mechanic claimed the starter motor was bad and “repaired” it.  
Turns out it wasn’t broken at all. What was done? A hacked-together starter that could fail at any moment, leaving the car stranded.

---

## Missing & Broken Everywhere

When we inspected the car properly, this is what we found:  


### Missing screws everywhere

Plug cover, timing cover, transmission mount, flywheel, intake plenum.

Missing or improperly installed screws might seem minor, but in a performance engine, they are **critical fasteners** that hold components in place under high stress.

* **Plug cover & timing cover screws**: These keep the top end sealed. Missing bolts can cause **oil leaks, dirt contamination, and improper valve timing**.
* **Transmission mount screws**: These secure the gearbox. Missing fasteners allow **misalignment, excessive vibration, and potential drivetrain failure**.
* **Flywheel screws**: The flywheel transmits engine torque to the clutch. Missing or incorrect bolts can **warp the flywheel, unbalance it, or even cause it to detach at high RPM** — a catastrophic safety hazard.
* **Intake plenum screws**: These hold the intake manifold tight. Missing bolts can cause **air leaks, poor engine performance, and check engine warnings**.

In short, missing screws mean the car is **structurally unsafe, mechanically compromised, and prone to serious failures** — all due to sloppy or careless workmanship.

### Broken Engine Mount

![Engine Mount](http://cdn.ebadfd.tech/mechanics-mess/engine-mount.jpg)

The engine mount was supposedly **rebuilt or replaced**, and my friend was charged for the work. Even if it was "fixed" at some point, it **has already failed**, leaving the engine insecure.

A broken engine mount allows the engine to **shift under load**, causing excessive vibrations, stressing other mounts, and potentially misaligning the drivetrain. In a performance car, this can also **damage the gearbox, clutch, or engine over time**, and drastically affect handling and reliability.

This isn't just negligence — it's a **shocking example of poor workmanship that directly impacts safety and performance**.


### Cracked transmission casing

![Broken Gearbox](http://cdn.ebadfd.tech/mechanics-mess/broken-gearbox.jpg)

The transmission casing has a visible crack, likely caused by hitting it or applying force during installation. 
This isn’t just cosmetic — a cracked casing weakens the gearbox structure, can misalign internal gears, and may lead to catastrophic failure under load.

Proper handling during assembly and careful mounting are essential; leaving it cracked is a serious safety and reliability issue.

### Broken tappet cover

![Broken Tappet](http://cdn.ebadfd.tech/mechanics-mess/broken-tappet-2.jpg)  

The tappet cover is cracked, most likely from over-tightening the bolts during installation.
This simple cover only needs to be snug to seal the top of the engine; forcing the bolts too tight caused the material to fracture.

This broken tappet cover resulted in oil leaks, improper valve operation, and potential contamination inside the engine - all for a mistake that's completely avoidable with proper torque control.


### Flywheel with missing/wrong screws

Wrong or missing bolts threw the flywheel out of balance and warped it, creating a serious safety hazard. In this front-wheel drive setup, the flywheel is directly connected to the engine, transmitting torque to the clutch and transmission. One of the bolts was even **stuck inside the crank** — thankfully, it didn’t damage the engine, but it could have **destroyed the clutch, gearbox, or engine itself at high RPM**.

![Flywheel](http://cdn.ebadfd.tech/mechanics-mess/flywheel.jpg)

The below image shows one of the flywheel bolts after removal. The head of the bolt is completely missing, 
and you can see the damage caused by this failure. It’s a clear indicator of how careless and dangerous the assembly was.

## Wiring Disaster

Critical wiring was left **exposed, broken, or taped together**:

* IAT
* Knock Sensor
* TPS
* IAC
* Fuel Pump

![Oil Pressure Wire](http://cdn.ebadfd.tech/mechanics-mess/oil-pressure-wire.jpeg)

Exposed or poorly insulated wires aren’t just a reliability issue — they pose a **serious fire risk**. 
A short circuit can ignite fuel vapors, melt surrounding components, or even start a fire in the engine bay.
On a performance engine, where voltages and currents can spike, this is **extremely dangerous**. 
Ignoring proper wiring safety shows a complete disregard for basic performance standards and driver safety.

And the funny thing? This mechanic **used to be an electrician**, which is what he was originally known for — yet somehow, 
all of these wiring basics were completely ignored.

## More Damage Discovered

Even beyond the engine and drivetrain, the car came back with **a long list of additional issues**:

* **Exhaust packing leak** — installed poorly, causing leaks and reduced engine performance.
* **Car exterior scratched and dented** — clearly, parts of the body were hit, leaving visible dents on the fenders.
* **Paint damaged from being left outside** — rain and sun exposure ruined the finish.
* **Wiper motor burnt** — completely destroyed, a clear sign of electrical negligence.
* **AC compressor broken** — left non-functional without explanation.

Every single issue reflects **careless, rushed, or incompetent work**, not the precision required for proper performance tuning.

And here’s the context: my friend **never rushed the mechanic**. We told him to take all the time he needed to do the job right. 
Even though some parts were expensive, my friend was willing to pay and support an "up-and-coming" mechanic.
Despite that, the car came back **worse than when it went in**, with dangerous and costly failures.

## The Blame Game

Instead of taking responsibility, the mechanic **kept shifting blame**:

* Blamed the ECU for timing issues (it wasn’t the ECU).
* Claimed the injectors were bad (they were fine).
* Said the plug wires were faulty (also fine).

The most shocking moment came when the service team asked whether a loose tube to the intake vacuum should be plugged. The mechanic said **"yes."**

That "loose tube" was actually a **fuel line**, dumping a couple of litres of petrol straight into the intake.

Imagine if the car had **caught fire** — the risk was real. This isn’t just negligence; it’s **reckless and dangerous**.

## Final Thoughts

This entire experience is a stark reminder:

**Be extremely careful who you trust with your car.**

Some "performance mechanics" will take your money, cut corners, and leave your car in a far worse and unsafe condition than before.

My friend spent **lot of money and months of his time**, yet ended up with a car that’s mechanically compromised, electrically unsafe, and cosmetically damaged.

If you’re giving your car for a rebuild or performance work:

* **Get references**
* **Check past work**
* **Don’t pay everything upfront**
* **Inspect carefully before driving away**

This wasn’t just bad service — it was **straight-up negligence and dangerous incompetence**.
I hope this rant helps someone avoid the same nightmare.
