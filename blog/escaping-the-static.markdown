This project explores a moody, retro-futuristic anime scene inspired by *Serial Experiments Lain*. The setting is a dimly lit, cluttered garage filled with broken retro computers, with a Toyota AE86 Trueno resting quietly inside. Leaning against it is a tired yet gentle Japanese woman. Outside, shattered windows reveal a neon-lit, post-apocalyptic cityscape, completing the surreal atmosphere.

To bring this vision to life, I used a variety of AI models:

* **Gemini Imagen 4 Preview** – Produced the most realistic results, particularly excelling in car details. However, it repeatedly generated a panda-colored liftback AE86 instead of the gray coupe I intended, likely due to limitations in its training data.
* **Flux 1.1 \[Pro] Ultra** – Delivered strong, stylized compositions with a striking visual mood, though the car sometimes appeared more synthetic than realistic.
* **Flux 1 \[DEV]** – Nearly on par with the Pro version, but with slightly less refinement and detail.
* **Recraft v3** – Created very futuristic images, but lacked realism.

Each model had its own strengths, which helped me explore different visual tones and narrative elements within the same concept.

After going through all my favorites, I realized I really liked the image generation capabilities of Gemini ImageGen 4. It stood out to me with how well it captured the AE86,
blending a distinct anime-inspired style with a surprising level of realism. In my opinion, that’s been my favorite so far.

details="Create a widescreen desktop wallpaper in a retro-futuristic 80s sci-fi anime style, strongly inspired by the moody, post-apocalyptic atmosphere of Serial Experiments Lain. Scene setting: A dimly lit, cluttered garage filled with broken, flickering retro computers, scattered tools, and tech debris. The environment is gritty but intimate, evoking a nostalgic, melancholic vibe. Key focal points: A Toyota AE86 Trueno 2-door coupé (specifically the coupe models produced between 1972–1979 and 1983–2000), painted gray. The car features signature pop-up headlights, shows subtle wear, and looks functional. The car must be the 2-door coupé model, never the liftback or any other variant. A cute Japanese woman with short, unstyled hair, wearing a slightly wrinkled office pantsuit (no skirt). She appears a bit tired from dealing with the broken tech but remains human, gentle, and relatable — not zombie-like or overly stylized. She stands near the car, preparing to drive away for a quiet escape. Background and mood: Through the garage windows, a neon-lit, ruined retro-futuristic cityscape is faintly visible, hinting at a harsh, post-apocalyptic world outside. The garage glows with warm, flickering light from the retro computers, contrasting with the cool neon hues outside. The overall tone is nostalgic, melancholic, quietly hopeful — a personal moment of calm amidst a broken retro-future. Color palette: Strictly follow this palette inspired by Serial Experiments Lain’s muted and contrasting tones: base00: #181b23, base01: #2a2f3a, base02: #3c3836, base03: #665c54, base04: #d3c8ba, base05: #eae3d9, base06: #f3eee5, base07: #f3eee5, base08: #d36c6c, base09: #e7a953, base0A: #f6c982, base0B: #a8c074, base0C: #78b6bc, base0D: #4d8dc4, base0E: #b18bbb, base0F: #d65d0e"
