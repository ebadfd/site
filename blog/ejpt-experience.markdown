Hello everyone! So I know its been a while since I passed the exam. I couldn't complete this article because I was busy with some personal stuff. Anyways here's my experience with the EJPT exam. so in case you don't know, EJPT stands for "eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester" and this is a 100% practical certification on penetration testing and information security essentials. and if you need to look for more information about this certification you can do it from their website. I have added the link for the certification on their website so feel free to check that out.

## My Background

So first of all here's a little bit about my background. so I'm a second-year cybersecurity student. and currently, I'm doing my degree at Plymouth University in cybersecurity; also I want to mention that I honestly don't have any industry experience. I haven't worked as a penetration tester anywhere. and I don't have much real-life experience. ( I have worked on some small projects and penetration tests for some friends but I don't think I got any good real-life experience from those projects ).

also when I talk about my background I want to mention that I do play a lot of ctfs myself. and that's one of the main ways I learn about new stuff. and play with things. in fact, you can check me out on try hack me and hack the box. from the below cards. and I think that's enough about me. so let's talk about the exam now

## Where did I practiced ?

So when it comes to studying for the exam I honestly didn't study a lot. I purchased my exam voucher on the 1st of August and I completed the exam on the 4th of August. but before participating in the exam I went through some material from the INE pts course. and also I completed all three black boxes from the INE labs. but I don't think that's essential to pass the exam since most of the stuff from those black boxes was not on the exam. in fact, those boxes were harder than the exam according to my experience.

I cant honestly tell if the INE training is good because I didn't cover the whole thing. but from what I did it was quite okay; even tho some videos were pretty old. some were using backtrack 5 to demonstrate the tools. but yeah.

for the most part, I used try hack me. thm is like my go-to platform to learn cybersecurity-related things. so if you haven't heard about or used try hack me before I would highly recommend that. also, I have a blog post about tryhackme you can even read about that to get more ideas about the platform

## What was my exam experience

So when we talking about the exam experience. the exam was a 3-day exam. and for me, it only took around 7-8 hours to complete. I would say the exam was pretty easy. it was not a very complex one and the exploits were pretty easy. but I got stuck with the initial step a bit. so if you are a person who plays ctfs a bit this might happen to you. since the exam is much different from the CTF type. the exam feels like a real-life penetration test most time so if you have some real-life experience I would say that would be very helpful here. but if you don't have real-life experience the INE labs will give you that experience.

so if you are planning to get the exam I would highly recommend studying some networking concepts like routing. since that will come helpful in the exam. so you won't get stuck,

also for purchasing the exam you can get it from the Elearn security website. the process was pretty simple you can add to cart and the pay the amount. after that, you can create an account from the same email you used to purchase the certification and you should get the certification in around 30 mins if its a weekday, but if you didn't get it don't get panic, this happened to me tbh , and I could not find any resources talking about this, but you can just send an email to [support@ine.com](mailto:support@ine.com) and they will add the exam to your account ( since this process is actually a manual one ) also if you need more help you can join to their unofficial discord server and you can definitely get some help from that ( that's what I did ).

also, another thing to remember in the exam is the exploits are really easy. so if something doesn't work for you on the first or second try just reset the exam lab. because this happened to me I was exploiting a very common RCE with Metasploit and it didn't work for me. I honestly wasted a lot of time figuring out why its not and then I rested the lab. and everything worked perfectly.

as I told you before the exam is a practical exam. but you have to fill a quiz to pass the exam. and don't think you can google the answers for the quiz since it won't work. the questions for the quiz is totally based on the exam; as an example,

```
what was the name of x who found y ?

- a
- b
- c
- d
```

this type of question ( this was a completely random one ) so don't think about that. you only get the answers if you hack your way into the network.

and the exam was overall good I would say. just remember that if something is not working you might need to reset the labs. also resetting the labs won't lose the answers you supported to the quiz.

The exam only tests you on very basic things, because of that you don't have to worry about other things like scripting or editing payloads you can probably exploit every machine with tools like Metasploit, sqlmap, Nmap.

## Study recommandations

So as for the recommendations, I would say it would be better if you look for some basic exploitations and some networking. and also I would like to recommend you some rooms :)

- Find the secret server - from INE
- [blue - Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue)
- [Lame - Hack the box](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/Lame)
- [Overpassed2 - Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/room/overpass2hacked)

so if you completed these rooms I would say you can complete the EJPT exam successfully. ( these rooms might not be enough but the exam is somewhat like these ones ) but again remember. the exam is not a CTF so I would say its better to do the black boxes from INE labs ( i would say the box 1 and 3 would be enough )

also; I created myself a small cheat sheet for the exam, that might help you. I will post it on my Github so that you can find it from there. and you can find a link below for the cheatsheet. I would say create your own one based on that or something from scratch. this will definitely help you in the exam. unless you can remember everything :)

## What can you expect frm the exam

So I would say EJPT has good recognition in the industry; so if you are looking for a job. this certification might help you out. and while comparing to the other certifications like CEH this is really good ( i personally haven't done CEH I'm just telling what I heard online ) the reason is since this is a hands-on exam you actually get some experience with the keyboard. but it just depends on you.

And when we talking about the price for the exam, Just for 200usd, you get 2 vouchers ( you can have a free retake if you fail the exam ) this is very good since you don't have a big headache while doing the exam because if u fail once you can take it free for the second time. and also I would say the exam is not a very stress full one.

overall I would say the exam is fine; its, not the most fun exam out there but you can definitely learn some new stuff. also, I earned 85% for the exam and I got 3 questions wrong. but yeah. the exam was okay

and if you are a beginner I would definitely recommend this certification mainly because its easy and the exam will train you for that penetration tester mindset. and also it doesn't have much stress.

## Final words

So as for the final words, I would say just give this exam a try if you are just starting out. because you can learn some new stuff. and if you are planning to do the exam, good luck :) I hope the content I wrote was helpful for you. again remember to look at some networking stuff and the rooms I suggested, you can crack the exam. also, don't hurry on the exam since you might miss some important things. I know people post online saying they completed the exam in 3-4h and stuff, don't take that securely. the certification doesn't mention how much time you took to complete it. also, who knows if they lying? I can even tell you I completed the exam in one hour and you probably never know how much time I really took. so don't worry about that. just take your time and do the exam. and have fun!

so that was it I guess, if you are planning to do the exam and if you have any questions reach out to me. I will definitely help you out. you can contact me via my discord or send an email

and if you are doing the exam I wish you all the best, you can crack the exam. if you are planning to do the exam just do. I would say its worth it.

that's it for my thoughts and experience on the exam. thanks for reading this. leave a comment if this helps you. and if you passed the exam let me know in the comments.

and as always, stay safe and keep on hacking!
